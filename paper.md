# Summary

psyplot [@psyplot] is an cross-platform open source python project that mainly
combines the plotting utilities of matplotlib [@Hunter2007] and the data
management of the xarray [@xarray] package and integrates them into a software
that can be used via command-line and via a GUI.

The main purpose is to have a framework that allows a fast, attractive,
flexible, easily applicable, easily reproducible and especially an interactive
visualization of data.

The ultimate goal is to help scientists in their daily work by providing a
flexible visualization tool that can be enhanced by their own visualization
scripts.

The framework is extended by multiple plugins: psy-simple [@psy-simple] for
simple visualization tasks, psy-maps [@psy-maps] for georeferenced data
visualization and psy-reg [@psy-reg] for the visualization of fits. It is
furthermore extended by the optional graphical user interface psyplot-gui
[@psyplot-gui].
