How to contribute
=================
psyplot and it's plugins are available open-source on Github. Here we very much
welcome your contributions!

In case of any troubles, need for clarification or suggestions, please open an
issue on `psyplots github page`_ (or on the corresponding plugins github page,
see :ref:`projects`). If you are not sure, where you should open the issue,
just use psyplots repository.

We also very much welcome pull requests for bug fixes, feature improvements or
additional examples. If you want to add an example to the documentation, please
just fork the correct github repository and add a jupyter notebook in the
``examples`` directory, together with all the necessary data files. To build
our docs, we use the sphinx-nbexamples_ package to build the examples.
Therefore please make sure that your supplementary data files are correctly
implemented in the meta data of the notebook (see
:ref:`sphinx_nbexamples:supp`). We are, however, also willing to help you
finalizing incomplete pull requests.
